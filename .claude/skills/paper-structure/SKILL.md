# Paper Structure Skill

Expert in structuring academic papers following established formats.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user asks to:
- Outline a research paper
- Structure an academic article
- Organize thesis or dissertation
- Plan conference paper or journal article

## Paper Types

### 1. Research Paper (IMRaD)
```
Abstract (150-250 words)
├── Introduction (10-15%)
│   ├── Research gap
│   ├── Research questions
│   └── Significance
├── Literature Review (15-20%)
│   ├── Theoretical background
│   ├── Previous work
│   └── Current state
├── Methods (10-15%)
│   ├── Participants/Data
│   ├── Procedure
│   └── Analysis
├── Results (15-20%)
│   ├── Descriptive statistics
│   ├── Inferential statistics
│   └── Visualizations
├── Discussion (20-25%)
│   ├── Interpretation
│   ├── Implications
│   ├── Limitations

└── References
```

### 2. Review Paper
```
Abstract

│   ├── Scope and objectives
│   └── Search strategy
├── Thematic Sections
│   ├── Theme 1: Theory/Foundations
│   ├── Theme 2: Methodologies
│   └── Theme 3: Applications/Gaps
├── Critical Analysis
│   ├── Trends and patterns
│   ├── Contradictions
│   └── Gaps
├── Conclusion
│   ├── Summary
│   └── Future directions
└── References
```

### 3. Conference Paper
```
Abstract (150-200 words)
├── Introduction (1-2 pages)

## Section Guidelines

### Abstract
- **Purpose**: Summarize entire paper
- **Length**: 150-250 words (varies by venue)
- **Content**:
  - Background/context (1-2 sentences)
  - Problem statement (1 sentence)
  - Methods (1-2 sentences)
  - Key results (2-3 sentences)
  - Conclusions/implications (1-2 sentences)

### Introduction
- **Hook**: Start broad, then narrow
- **Gap**: What's missing in current knowledge
- **Questions**: Specific research questions
- **Significance**: Why this matters
- **Roadmap**: Brief outline of paper structure

### Methods
- **Participants**: Who/what was studied
- **Materials**: What tools/instruments were used
- **Procedure**: Step-by-step process
- **Analysis**: Statistical or analytical methods

### Results
- Report findings objectively
- Use tables and figures effectively
- Include descriptive and inferential statistics
- Don't interpret results here

### Discussion
- **Interpret**: What results mean
- **Compare**: How they relate to previous work
- **Implications**: Theoretical and practical
- **Limitations**: What the study can't conclude
- **Future**: Next steps for research

## Word Count Guidelines

| Section | Percentage | 8000-word paper |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| Abstract | 2-3% | 150-250 words |
| Introduction | 10-15% | 800-1200 words |
| Lit Review | 15-20% | 1200-1600 words |
| Methods | 10-15% | 800-1200 words |
| Results | 15-20% | 1200-1600 words |
| Discussion | 20-25% | 1600-2000 words |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Introducing new results in Discussion
- ❌ Interpreting results in Results section
- ❌ Inconsistent terminology across sections
- ❌ Missing clear connections between sections
- ❌ Overly broad introductions that don't narrow down
- ❌ Methods that can't be replicated

## Quick Structure Examples

### Generate Structure
```
Create an IMRaD structure for a paper on:
"Using transformer models for sentiment analysis"
```

### Estimate Word Counts
```
For a 6000-word paper on "climate change impacts",
estimate word counts for each section.
```

### Section Breakdown
```
Provide detailed subsections for the Methods section
of a study on "user experience with mobile apps".
```
